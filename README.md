- 👋 Hi, I’m @robert-optimistic
- 👀 I’m interested in optimizing all kind of stuff, 3D and 2D design, and that our children will have a future worth living.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Computer Science, and how to live a sustainable life.
- 🤷 Sorry if this repo won't be very useful. I'll just use it for unrelated stuff that needs to be public.
